# BSPWM_dotfiles
First, run this comand to install the required packages 
```
sudo pacman -S  xorg bspwm sxhkd git rofi polybar vim picom kitty nitrogen pulseaudio
```
<br /> don't forget to update your system and to download the ```base-devel``` package before  <br />
<br /> I use ```polkit-gnome``` as the polkit

You also need to install and configure  ```lxappearance```, ```kvantum``` and ```qt5ct``` so that all the apps have your custom theme


<p> The fonts is dejavu, to install it run 

```
sudo pacman -S  ttf-dejavu
```
</p>



The fork of picom I'm using to get the animations is the 
```picom-animations-git``` on the AUR
